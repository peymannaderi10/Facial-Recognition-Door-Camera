Run "make" to compile the project, and then run "./DoorLock" to run the executable.
Please note that in order to compile and run the program, you will need the OpenCV
and wiringPi libraries. Additionally, some directories that are hard coded into the
code might need to be changed depending on the OS. Lastly, this program controls
physical hardware, therefore the system will not function properly without
the hardware wired to the Raspberry Pi. We have uploaded a video showing the functionality
of the program.
